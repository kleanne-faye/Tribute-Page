   <h2>4 - 6BC Approx. Jesus’ Birth</h2>

  	 <p>-Ancient Hebrew writings, dating from hundreds of years before Jesus’ birth, foretold the arrival of a Messiah who would lead his people to freedom. The Bible book, Micah, says ‘But you Bethlehem… out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel…’<br>Jesus’ conception was unique. Christianity teaches that his mother, Mary, is a virgin and falls pregnant at the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Mary and her husband, Joseph, travel to his family’s home town of Bethlehem to register in a census ordered by the Romans, who occupied the region at the time. Jesus is born while they are in Bethlehem. Shepherds visit the baby and bow down in praise. When he is eight days old, Jesus is circumcised as is traditional for Jewish boys. When he is just over a month old, Mary and Joseph take Jesus to Jerusalem to present him at the temple where they offer sacrifices to God (another tradition).</p>

   <h2>4 BC Approx. Wise men visit and Jesus escapes to Egypt</h2>

   <p>-Wise men arrive in Jerusalem from eastern lands. They are looking for an infant who has been born ‘King of Jews’. King Herod – disturbed at the idea of a rival – asks the wise men to tip him off when they find the boy. The wise men find Jesus lying in a manger and worship him but return home by another route without telling Herod. Furious, Herod orders the massacre of all boys aged two or under in Bethlehem. But, warned in a dream, Joseph, Mary and Jesus flee to safety in Egypt. They stay until Herod dies. Historians believe this was in 4 BC.</p>

   <h2>8 AD approx. Jesus’ Childhood – Left behind in Jerusalem</h2>

   <p>-Joseph, Mary and Jesus return from Egypt to their home at Nazareth in Galilee. Aged 12, Jesus goes to Jerusalem with his parents for the Jewish festival of Passover. Mary and Joseph head home mistakenly leaving Jesus behind. They return to look for him. After three days they find him in the temple, talking to the religious teachers. The Bible book, Luke, says ‘Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers’. When Mary challenges him about his absence, Jesus replies, ‘Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?’ – the first indication he knows of his divinity. This is the only Bible story about Jesus’ childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.</p>

   <h2>28 AD approx. Jesus is Baptised and Tempted by the Devil</h2>

   <p>-Radical teacher John the Baptist – a relative of Jesus – is attracting crowds out into the desert. He’s urging them to give up their bad behaviour and attitudes. He says he is preparing the way for a greater teacher. Jesus leaves Nazareth and goes out into the desert. John says this is the teacher he’d been talking about. The Bible book, John, quotes John saying, ‘Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world… this is one I meant…’ He baptises Jesus in the River Jordan at Bethany. The Bible book, Matthew, says that as Jesus prayed, ‘...heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son whom I love; with you I am well pleased”’. Immediately Jesus goes into the Judean desert for 40 days without food. The devil tempts him three times but Jesus resists. The devil departs. Jesus returns to Galilee and makes Capernaum his home base.</p>

   <p>-Jesus clears the temple in Jerusalem of rogue merchants and money-changers. He begins to teach and heal sick people who come to him. He meets a senior Jewish leader, Nicodemus, in secret and tells him he must be ‘born again’ if he wants to have a close relationship with God.<br>Jesus teaches in synagogues across Galilee. He is rejected in Nazareth where people threaten to throw him off a cliff. He continues to teach and miraculously heal sick people, including Simon Peter’s mother-in-law. Matthew, a tax collector despised for collaborating with the occupying Romans, becomes a follower. Jesus chooses 12 men to be his closest followers (disciples).<br>Huge crowds are now following Jesus. Overlooking the Sea of Galilee,Jesus sets out a Christian manifesto, teaching on a range of life’s issues including loving enemies, retaliation, anger, lust, divorce, worry, giving to the needy and criticising others. More healings follow. Samaritans and a Roman centurion believe in his teachings. Jesus raises a widow’s son and a young girl from the dead. He uses simple stories, known as parables, to teach deep spiritual truths.<br>Religious leaders are antagonised by his teaching and apparent breach of laws about the Jewish Sabbath. They begin to challenge him. Jesus miraculously calms a storm. He sends out the 12 disciples to heal the sick. Jesus begins to predict his death and resurrection. Religious leaders question his authority. Jesus condemns their hypocrisy. They begin to plot to kill him.</p>

   <p>-Jesus and his followers head to Jerusalem for the annual Passover festival. Crowds welcome him as the long-awaited Messiah. Jesus infuriates the religious authorities by overthrowing tables in the temple and condemning the leaders’ hypocrisy. A disciple, Judas, agrees to betray Jesus. After celebrating the Passover meal with his disciples, Jesus is arrested. He goes before Jewish and Roman authorities charged with blasphemy. The Jewish authorities demand the death penalty. Jesus is crucified on (Good) Friday. His body is laid in a tomb. When his followers go to retrieve it on (Easter) Sunday, the body has gone. They are told Jesus has risen from the dead. Jesus appears to his disciples and more than 500 other followers over the next six weeks. Then, on the top of the Mount of Olives, Jesus rises up to heaven in front of his followers and disappears from view.</p>

   <h2>Miracles of Jesus Christ</h2>
   <ul>
   	<li>Turning water into wine in Cana of Galilee (John 2:1-11)</li>
   		<p>There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and Mary, the mother of Jesus, was there and also Jesus himself and the disciples. And when they wanted wine (bride/groom/guest), they have no wine. Mary told Jesus that there's no wine left than Jesus said "<i>Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come</i>". Then his mother said to the servants that whatever Jesus told them to do, they shall do it. Jesus then said to the servants to fill the waterpots with water, after filling, He said to the servants that they draw some out of the water from the waterpots and take it to the governor of the feast. When the governor has tasted the water that was made wine, which he knew not, the governor of the feast was amazed and called the bridegroom and said that they have still kept the good wine until now. This was the first miracle of Jesus.</p>
   	<li>Healing the royal official's son in Capernaum (John 4:46-54)</li>
   		<p>There was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Caperanum. When he heard that Jesus was came out of Judea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. The Jesus said unto him "<i>Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe".</i> The noblema said to Jesus that He should come down for his son will die. Then Jesus said to him <i>"Go thy way, thy son liveth".</i>And when the nobleman was going home, his servants met him and said that his son liveth. This is the second miracle that Jesus did when was in Judea.</p>
   	<li>Healing the paralytic at Bethesda (John 5:1-15)</li>
   		<p>This time, there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is a Jerusalem by the gate there is a pool, which is calle in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In that place there were many sick people, there were lame, blind, paralyzed waiting for the moving of the water. And a certain man was there which had an infirmity 38 years. Jesus saw him lie and knew that he was sick of a long time and ask him if he want to be healed and the sick man said that he don't have anyone to take him to the pool and Jesus said <i>"Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."</i> Then immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.</p>
   	<li>Feeding the 5000 (John 6:5-14)</li>
   		<p>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which was the sea of Tiberias. And many people followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were deceased. And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples, and the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. And when Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great crowd, he saith unto Philip <i>"Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"</i> And Philip answered that 200 pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them. Then one of his disciples, Andrew said unto him that there is a kid that have five barley loaves and two small fishes. Then Jesus made them sit and there were about five thousand men. And Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks to God, he distributed to the disciples and unto the people. And when they are all filled, Jesus said to his disciples that they will gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing shall be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</p>
   	<li>Jesus walking on water (John 6:16-24)</li>
   		<p>After the feeding of five thousand men, when it was already evening, his disciples went down unto the sea, and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward Capernaum. It was now dark and Jesus was not with them. Then the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawning near unto the ship and they were afraid but he said unto them <i>"It is I; be not afraid".</i> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</p>
   	<li>Healing the man blind from birth (John 9:1-7)</li>
   		<p>tThere was a blind man since birth that Jesus saw as he passed by and his disciples ask him who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered <i>"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him".</i> When he has spoken, he spat on the ground and made clay of the saliva, and he applied the clay upon the eyes of the blind man and said unto him <i>"Go, wash in the pool of Siloam".</i> The blind man did what Jesus said and washed and he can now see and he praised the Lord.</p>
   	<li>The raising of Lazarus (John 11:1-45)</li>
   		<p> Lazarus of Bethany was the brother of Martha and Mary and lived at Bethany, near Jerusalem. The account notes that Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters and that when Lazarus died of illness, Jesus wept and was “greatly disturbed.” Although Lazarus had been entombed for four days by the time Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was raised by Jesus from the dead and emerged from the tomb wearing his burial cloths</p>
